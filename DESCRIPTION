Description: This package simulates the Monty Hall Problem
game.  There are three doors that a contestant must choose 
from, one contains a new car and the two others contain goats.
After selecting their original door, a remaining door contianing 
a goat is opened.  After that the contestant has the ability to 
switch their choice to the remaining door or stay with their original
choice.  This package examines the liklihood of success in winning the 
game and car by simulating both strategies.
